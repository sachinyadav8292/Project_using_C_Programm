# Project_using_C_Programm
I, [Sachin Kumar Yadav], commit to completing the Number Guessing Project in C with dedication and attention to detail. I will ensure that the program is designed with clarity and efficiency, using appropriate algorithms and logic to meet the following objectives:

>> Functionality: The program will allow the user to input guesses and receive feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct, with the goal of guessing a randomly generated number within a specified range.
>> User Interface: The user interface will be simple, intuitive, and clear, guiding the user through each step of the game.
>> Error Handling: Proper error handling will be incorporated to manage invalid inputs and ensure the program runs smoothly.
>> Code Quality: The code will be well-commented, readable, and maintainable, following best practices for programming in C.
>> Testing: I will test the program thoroughly to ensure that it functions correctly under different scenarios and edge cases.
